# BlogN-Roll
This project was worked on by me and my Partner Ivan Poloanco for Our 226 Class project

This project is suppose to simulate, a Rock and Roll Blog page where there are three different type of profiles,
Admin, Band, and User, Admin page confirms Concert dates and chooses how many tickets they want to sell on the website. 
The band profile gets to upload concert dates to be sold on the blog, and update the User of the blog of new information about there band. 
Users get to read the Blog Information, and Have access to tickets Page where they are able to purchase tickets to a concert.

This project is runned by a local host

Pages User, Admin, Session, and ticket are saved under a file Classes under the BlogN'Role File

Page Connection is saved under a file Called Data base

All the information that the data base is suppose to have is saved under RockBase.SQL file 

The Code is almost 100% effective, We did have issues with with the ticket purchase code and did not get this 100% fully operational
